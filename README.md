Shell is a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. It allows you to type commands that the computer will execute, and provides a way to navigate the file system, launch applications, and perform various other tasks.
<br />
#Syntax
<br />
The syntax for shell commands varies depending on the specific command and the shell being used. However, most shell commands follow a basic structure that includes the name of the command followed by one or more arguments.  
<br />
Built-ins
<br />
There are two built-ins programmed into the shell. 
<br />
- env - The env command is a command that tells the shell program to display all of the environment variables with their values. It is a way to access those values through the shell.
- exit - Terminates the current process and returns control to the operating system.
